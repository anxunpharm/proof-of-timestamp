Project Title: Proof of Timestamp
Overview
The Proof of Timestamp project aims to demonstrate the concept of timestamping data using blockchain technology. It ensures the immutability and authenticity of data by associating it with a specific time.

Features
Timestamping: Users can submit data (such as files, text, or hashes) to the system, which then generates a timestamp and stores it on the blockchain.
Verification: Anyone can verify the timestamp by checking it against the blockchain. If the data remains unchanged, the timestamp is valid.
